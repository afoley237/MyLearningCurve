    <p class="coolborder"><i><strong>Basketball</strong> is one of my favorite hobbies. I often play with my fraternity brothers at the east campus rec. We often will get big groups
        of people to go over there in the evenings and play until it is late into the evening and everyone has to leave to get homework
        done but it is good to hangout with friends in this positive environment.</i>

    <p>In my spare time I enjoy working on cars. When I was a sophmore in high school my parents challenged me to pick a different
        hobby as I played a lot of video games, so I bought a broken cadillac and rebuilt the engine and fixed the car. I did this 
        with little mechanical experience and enjoyed it so I did a different broken car for each of the next four summers.
